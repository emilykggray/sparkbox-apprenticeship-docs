* distributed version control system
* everyone has a copy of the code, broken out by version
* you can clone a copy, and find out the history
* not necessary to be connected to the internet, until you want to push your changes
* $ git clone
$ git push
* a file system within a file system: a bunch of commands to work within a file system
* tower is a decent GUI for Git, as well as GitHub for Mac
* but there is a disadvantage to using a GUI, because it hides complexities, and makes decisions for you
