# Apprenticeship Goals
Overall, I want to develop a deep understanding of front-end web development practices, with the aim of gaining a full time job as a front-end web developer in an agency setting. With a strong existing skillet in HTML and CSS, I want to master these skills and learn Sparkbox’ practices of semantic markup and SASS. I want to supplement these skills with programming ability in Ruby on Rails, and most importantly, learn to build web apps, consume APIs and add interactivity to websites using JavaScript.

## JavaScript
* develop an understanding of Vanilla JS
* deepen understanding of event-driven jQuery and animation
* learn to use a JS MVC framework like ember.js with Handlebars or  angular.js
* learn to consume JSON feeds and APIs

## CSS
* master the use of the SASS preprocessor
* user a front-end framework like Bourbon or Compass
* develop an understanding of CSS3 animation

## HTML
* gain some experience using and animating SVG and Canvas
* learn more about optimizing site performance
* learn the best alternative to multiple image sizes for responsive
* master form handling

## Tooling
* gain experience with Grunt build tool
* master use of Git for version control
* become comfortable in the command line

## Backend
* gain experience integrating with Ruby on Rails
* build a rudimentary Rails app

# Fears
As is obvious from my list of goals, I want to learn a lot. So my biggest fear is that I won’t be able to focus on the most important things on this list (becoming a JavaScript pro) by the time this short six months is over. It will be a challenge for me to narrow down my goals and focus on the most critical bits.
