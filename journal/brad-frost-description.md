# Brad Frost Maker Series Workshop Description

## Brad’s Promise
You’ll walk away with tools that will help you get started building pattern libraries today—and an in-depth understanding about the principles of atomic design. With new workflows, deliverables, and resources, you’ll be equipped to start using these tools, so you can stop designing pages and start building design systems.

## Workshop Description
The way we build websites has changed dramatically, and it’s still transforming rapidly. No longer are we building a bunch of pages for our clients and handing them off to just die on the line. We need to build design systems that are extensible, useful, and that stand the test of time. You’ll learn a new approach to building  systems based on parts of a whole—atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages—and how they fit into pattern libraries and the Pattern Lab tool. Gone are the days of the massive rebuild, now we build design systems that can be gradually expanded upon, making websites more consistent and future-proof. It’s a brave new era.
