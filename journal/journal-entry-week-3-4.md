# Journal Entry - Week 3 & 4 (1-26 - 2-6)
I’ve been a little irresponsible with my journal entries lately, so this one is going to be a catch-up for the last two weeks. They’ve been weeks filled with Ruby-learning, katas, and a lot of code exercises.

## Learning Ruby
Jumping right into programming has been an exciting way to start the apprenticeship, as it’s definitely my weakest skill set as it relates to making things on the internet. The Ruby programming language seems like a great place to start, with its emphasis on object oriented programming and readability. Wrapping my head around an object-oriented approach has been the most challenging thing about writing Ruby code, but is finally starting to make sense to me, especially after digging into *Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby* (*POOPR*) and *Learn Ruby the Hard Way* (*LRHW*). 

### *POOPR* and *LRHW*
One of the most useful takeaways after reading through *POOPR* and *LRHW* was how to look at and solve problems in programming.  I’ve found it useful to look at programming problems by first writing out the problem in longhand — describing the problem in natural language. I then look through the description I’ve written and isolate the nouns and verbs (an approach advocated in *LRHW*) — from there I get great starting points for classes and methods. It helps me think of things in a more object-oriented way, and solve problems before I dive into the code. 

The next logical step is to create an outline of my solution using sort of natural language dummy code — outlining my classes with their respective methods without using actual Ruby syntax. I’ve found this is one of the best ways around separating thinking through problems from actual execution, especially as I work toward understanding the Ruby language. This way, I can solve the problem at a high level, then do the necessary research to find appropriate implementation in code.

While I’m not yet finished reading *POOPR*, it’s helped me to think about how to structure my code, breaking things down into single, isolated responsibilities. One class should solve one specific problem, with methods that have clearly-defined responsibilities. This approach combined with the nouns and verbs approach, coupled with thinking things out in natural language and outlines has really helped me get over the initial hurdles of actually writing code. It’s really helped me get real with my problem solving in code.

### TDD, RSPEC, and Code Katas
Test Driven Development is another new concept to me, and one that I can see a lot of benefit in learning more about. As I’ve worked through the Triangle and Yahtzee code katas, I’ve already noticed a huge advantage to following these principles. Starting by writing a failing test (red), then making the test pass (green), and then cleaning up your code (refactor), is a great approach to building your code in a more object-oriented, methodical, and modular way. It lends itself well to breaking a problem down into its individual parts, and not getting bogged down in the high-level aspects of a problem.

Codeschool’s RSPEC courses gave me a great introduction to a well-used and documented testing framework — which got me started on the right foot. My implementations so far have been pretty simplistic and rudimentary (making use of this framework in both the Triangle Kata and the Yahtzee Kata), but I can see expanding my knowledge of this framework as I progress. I can see a lot of benefit in going back through the course another time in order to learn some of the tips and tricks that will help me implement some more advanced stuff for a DRYer approach.

### Ruby Goals
My main goals for my continued Ruby learning revolve around just getting more practical experience writing code. I plan on working through as many code katas as possible over the next several weeks, and working on different ways to solve each. I also plan on playing through the Ruby Bits 2 course over the next week or two now that I have more experience writing code. I want to continue to work on a test driven approach and honing my ability to solve problems. I should also make a concerted effort to read a lot of the Ruby spec in dash as I’m working through the katas, trying to find new ways of solving problems.

It will also be important to continue pairing up on problems with more experienced Ruby programmers. This seems like the fastest way to learn better approaches, and to find better ways to structure my code. I also want to experiment with approaches that incorporate more than one or two classes, trying to better encapsulate my code and keep responsibilities well defined. I’d also like to work on a project that requires multiple Ruby files, and of course continue to improve my RSPEC testing abilities.
