# Journal Entry - Week 1 (1-12 - 1-16)
So, here’s how I spent my first week at Sparkbox: in between time spent working through three Git Code School courses, and learning to customize my Shell, I slightly improved my pingpong game, learned about ping-volley-ball-pong, had my first experience with an Oculus Rift, and ate enough delicious food to help me gain at least five pounds. I’ll go ahead and touch on each of those subjects briefly, as journaling is a bit new to me, and I don’t really know how else to proceed.

## Git
To me, it seems like the possibilities that open up after mastering Git are pretty much endless. Working better together in groups, tracking and maintaining code, working more efficiently, learning how to deploy and control sites more effectively — are just a few of the advantages I imagine after learning this useful technology.

The Code School courses were super useful, and I feel like I already have a pretty strong grasp on how to use Git, but I don’t feel like I will be fully comfortable in it until I start working on some group projects. To that end, I spent Friday making a couple branches, pulling one of my fellow apprentice’s contributions, and making a pull request. I’m also tracking all my personal work using Git and Github. Feels like a pretty strong start. 

## Shell Customization
It’s funny to think that before I started this apprenticeship (and it’s only been a week), that I was really intimidated by the command line. I guess I figured that by working in it, I would undoubtedly break things because I didn’t really know what I was doing. But, after a week of working in it, I already feel more comfortable, and have mostly gotten over that fear. My main goal with working in the shell is to get to the point where I don’t ever have to feel like I need to open Finder again. I’m getting there.

Some slight customizations to my prompt, and a little playing around with Vim, as well as some nice color themes have added to me feeling more comfortable. Syntax highlighting and a prompt that tells me my current directory path, and the Git branch I am currently on make life a lot easier.

## Ping Pong and Ping-Volley-Ball-Pong
Ping Pong is another thing that I had avoided out of fear up to this point (seems like something of a theme starting here). It’s one of those games that I never really dove in to, and it got to the point that I felt like I would never really learn — so I avoided playing. 

After a couple games of PVBP — and some much-needed mentorship by Rob Harr on straight up Ping Pong — I feel like my skill level has gone from a 1 out of 10 to a 2 out of 10. Which is pretty good progress for week one. I’m learning that it is very much a game of soft touches, repetition, muscle memory, and control. Definitely something I need to practice every week.

## Oculus Rift
I figured that at my old job, I’d have plenty of opportunities to play around with cool gadgets, seeing as I was writing about them. Unfortunately, that was never really the case. Funny that in my first week working at Sparkbox, I got hands-on experience with one of the hottest new gadgets available. One of the developers, Patrick Simpson, attended an all-day workshop on building games for Oculus Rift in Unity. He built a game where you walk around a castle-like plaza and throw tater tots at teddy bears.

Needless to say, playing this was a pretty cool experience. The opportunities for 3D immersive gaming with this kind of tech seem pretty promising. And honestly, what wouldn’t be fun about throwing tots at bears in a virtual environment. As an aside, I am seriously impressed by the ability of the guys in this shop. To be able to build great websites is one thing, but then taking their skills and applying them programming games (even if they are silly), is pretty impressive.

## Delicious Food
I had no idea the extent to which I’d be fed in this apprenticeship. I’ve eaten like a fat kid all week (and probably taken some steps towards being a fat kid as well). There’s so much food everywhere at Sparkbox, from boxes of Oreos in every variety, to great pizza, and other nearby eating options. Friday lunch had to be the highlight though, with steak from the grill, asparagus, salad, and a baked potato bar. (I was pretty proud of my contribution to the meal: lovingly making bacon bits for the potato bar.)

Next week will be the first week I will have to bake something as part of my apprentice duties. I’ve never been much of a baker, so this might be the biggest challenge I’ll face so far. I want to make something good, but I don’t want to screw it up. Maybe I’ll make cupcakes or something from a mix. Those seem like a thing that I could avoid screwing up. But I do love cookies. Decisions, decisions.

## Wrapping Up
That pretty much covers my week. I think I’d like to conclude these journal entries with some goals and things that I want to focus on the following week, so here goes.

* Work on editing the Apprentice Syllabus — I’d like to see more focus placed on JavaScript, in favor of HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I should talk to Drew and Ryan about how we can tinker with the second section syllabus to reflect this, and see if my fellow apprentices agree.
* Figure out a better way to get my reading done — I haven’t made as much progress on the reading assignments as I’d like. I think borrowing a tablet and spending some time in the quiet areas to get some of that done would be a good way to focus better.
* Start getting a blog set up on my personal site — I updated my site to get this job, but I want to make further improvements to that so that I can start publishing and more easily updating it. I’d like to use either Jekyll or Middleman, and get it hosted on Github Pages. I think this would be good practice, and probably a good way of putting my journal entries up on the internet. 

I think that’s enough for this week. Next week we’ll start working on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Could not be more excited to learn a new programming language that could help expand my skills beyond front-end templating to actually building web apps. Should be really great.
