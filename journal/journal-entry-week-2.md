# Journal Entry - Week 2 (1-19 - 1-23)
Alright, the second week of my apprenticeship at Sparkbox is behind me, and I already feel like I’m learning a lot. But the more I learn, the more I realize how far I still have to go. During week 2 I dug deeper into the command line, and GIT, while getting my feet wet with the Ruby language. I also finished readying the 37 Signals book "Getting Real," and plan to frame this journal entry within the context of that book. So, here’s how I got real in my second week as a Sparkbox apprentice.

## Getting Real
My most important takeaway from reading this book was to stop talking about doing things, and actually do them. I think this is an issue that plagues lots of creative people: plenty of great ideas, but way too little execution. I’ve spent a lot of time talking about things I want to make:

* Getting my personal site set up to blog
* Building my girlfriend Chelsea a personal site that would accommodate a portfolio and blog
* Getting MidwestMakers.com off the ground
* Building an Instagram feed on WelcomeToCincinnati.me

…but it’s always been a lot of talk. It’s been much easier for me to talk about doing things, than actually doing them. I got bogged down in technology, plans, and ideas, rather than execution.

_[Getting Real][1]_ talks about the value of an idea with no execution, versus the value of an idea with execution. Essentially, it says that a great idea isn’t worth much without execution. So, when you have an idea, the most important step is to just start coding. Don’t get too bogged down in the intangible future of what you’re building, just start coding. So I took that to heart this week and made some progress on two of those goals.

## Enter Github Pages and Jekyll
While these might seem like something of a diversion from the curriculum of this apprenticeship, I think working with this software is actually a really awesome way of reinforcing some of the stuff I learned in week 1, and stepping into some of the stuff I learned in week 2. [Github Pages][2] is a free, hosted solution for getting a static site up and running. And [Jekyll][3] takes it a step further, since it’s a blog-aware static site generator for your Github repos that’s powered by Ruby. So, I got to get a lot of practice with GIT while doing these setups, and saw a lot of Ruby code that looked familiar underneath the hood. Hopefully as I get deeper into learning Ruby, I can use this to build some cool custom functionality.

### My Personal Site
One of the goals I made for myself last week (and really an ongoing goal) was to take my personal site from a static resume site, to a blog. I’ve made some critical steps in that direction, getting it setup as a Jekyll-powered site. While it’s still hosted at [Github Pages][4], I’ll be getting it up and running on my personal domain this week after making some configuration changes.

### Chelsea’s Personal Site
[Chelsea’s site][5] is up and running on her newly-registered domain name, and it’s powered by Jekyll as well. While it is far from complete, I’m feeling like this is a great step. I still need to:

* Get prose.io configured so it’s easy to edit
* Set up a way to add work separate from the blog
* Turn the keys over to her
* Make everything responsive and do some testing

## Learning Ruby
In this last week I’ve taken my first dive into the Ruby programming language. While it’s still really early in my training, I feel like things are starting to click for me after finishing Ruby Bits 1 on [Codeschool][6] and completing the [Ruby Koans][7]. I still have a lot to do, and some things haven’t quite coalesced yet, but I feel like once I actually try to build something in Ruby, it will start to make a lot more sense.

I think one important thing for me as I get deeper into this apprenticeship is to curb some of my expectations. Learning Ruby in a week is probably not something anyone can do, and I need to recognize that comprehension will come with time, practice, and experience. That and working with some of the pros around Sparkbox to gain from their insight.

## Goals for Next Week
Most of my goals for next week will revolve around gaining some deeper comprehension in Ruby. Learning more about the way classes work, understanding object oriented programming, etc. So, I’ll need to:

* Wrap up Ruby Bits 1 and work on Ruby Bits 2
* Peer up with some of the guys as they’re working through a Ruby project
* Work some more on the Ruby Warriors game
* Finish reading Passionate Programmer
* Get started on Practical OOP in Ruby
* Find a small project to work through (maybe build a yahtzee game scorer)

On a more personal note, I want to:
* Wrap things up on my personal site
* Get Chelsea’s personal site finished

I think that about covers it for this week. On to week 3.
